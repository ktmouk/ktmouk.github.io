  <p class="text-slate-700">
    I am a front-end developer living in Tokyo, Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ. I like both front-end
    and back-end. Basically I'm work as front-end engineer in a company, but I'm
    also happy to write backend code when needed.

    On weekends, I also like to look into the workings of popular libraries such
    as React and create my own web services.

  <p class="text-slate-700">
    I love simple, minimal and easy-to-use web services.
